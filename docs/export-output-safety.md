# Export output transaction guarantees

The selected user target is never passed to FFmpeg. Each export creates an empty staging file with
`QIODevice::NewOnly` in the target directory and records that exact path in the live
`ExportOutputTransaction`. FFmpeg writes only to that staging file. Cancellation, worker failure,
validation failure, forced worker termination, and controller destruction remove only paths in that
ownership record. Filename shape alone is never treated as proof of ownership.

An export reaches transaction commit only after final media validation. Exact success and the narrow
`SuccessWithWarning` terminal-deficit case use this same staging/commit path; a warning is eligible
only for one through ten missing terminal frames with all other media, staging, progress, and exact
contiguous-CFR timing checks passing. A surplus or any other validation failure leaves staging owned
for normal cleanup and never replaces the selected target.

For a new target, the staging file is renamed to the target on the same filesystem after final media
validation. The transaction refuses to commit if another file appeared at the target while encoding.

Existing symbolic links and Windows reparse points are rejected during preparation. The transaction
does not follow a link to its referent and does not replace a link while describing that action as an
overwrite of the referent. Existing targets must be explicit regular files.

For an existing regular-file target, replacement requires the controller's explicit
`overwriteAllowed` flag. At that approved preparation, `ExportTargetIdentity` captures native file
identity plus size and high-resolution modification state without reading or hashing file contents:

- macOS/Unix uses `lstat(2)` device, inode, size, and native nanosecond modification time;
- Windows opens the pathname for attributes without following a reparse point and records volume
  serial, file index, size, and native last-write time.

Immediately before replacement, the transaction captures the pathname again. A different native
identity detects replacement; changed size or modification state detects in-place modification. A
missing, linked, non-regular, changed, or unverifiable target refuses commit. Disappearance is not
reinterpreted as permission for a new-target export. The external pathname is never removed by this
failure path, and the FlappedEar-owned staging file remains governed by normal transaction/manifest
cleanup. The resulting controller and persistent-log error explicitly says encoding finished but the
destination changed and was not overwritten.

For an identity-matched existing target, the existing atomic replacement remains unchanged:

- macOS (and other POSIX builds): `rename(2)` replaces the directory entry atomically. A crash exposes
  either the old complete file or the new complete file; there is no delete-then-rename window.
- Windows: `ReplaceFileW` with `REPLACEFILE_WRITE_THROUGH` replaces the existing file as one system
  operation. If Windows rejects the replacement, the existing target remains in place and the staged
  file remains owned for cleanup.
- Other platforms: the fallback renames the target to a transaction-owned backup, installs staging,
  and rolls the backup back if installation fails. This preserves the old file on ordinary operation
  failure, but it does not claim crash atomicity between the two renames.

Portable pathname replacement still has a residual race between the final native identity check and
`rename(2)` / `ReplaceFileW`. The check is placed directly before that operation, with no logging or
other work between them, reducing exposure from the complete export duration to this small final
commit interval. Eliminating it completely would require more invasive platform-specific directory-
handle or conditional-rename mechanisms and is outside the current transaction design.

Input video, VBO/RCZ telemetry, and known transaction paths are compared using cleaned absolute paths and canonical
paths where Qt can resolve them, including canonicalized parent directories. This collision comparison
is separate from the explicit rejection of a linked output target.

Free-space checks do not require a staging, temporary, or final artifact to exist. Each intended path
is resolved upward to its nearest existing filesystem ancestor, while diagnostics retain the original
intended path.

## Active artifact manifests and recovery

Before a worker is started, the controller writes an atomic versioned JSON manifest in the system temporary directory. It records the export UUID, creation time, worker PID, state, temporary FFV1 path, staging path, and final target for diagnostics. The manifest is the authorization record: only its validated overlay and staging paths may be removed automatically; the final target is never a cleanup candidate.

The separate per-export diagnostic log is stored beneath the application-data `exports` directory, never beside the executable or selected output. Its retention cleanup recognizes only the application's `export-*.log` filename convention inside that dedicated directory; it does not authorize removal of output, manifest, or arbitrary support files.

On normal success, cancellation, or failure the controller removes those owned artifacts and the manifest. Worker shutdown explicitly defers manifest-owned removal to that controller authority instead of reporting a false deletion failure. Cleanup is idempotent: an absent artifact or already-removed manifest is success, while a path that still exists and cannot be removed is a real failure and leaves the manifest for retry. At application startup the janitor reads only FlappedEar manifest files, rejects malformed records, skips a record whose PID or Unix process group is still active, and removes only paths proven by the valid manifest. Names such as `*.mkv` or `*.part.mp4` alone never authorize deletion.

PID reuse can conservatively cause an old manifest to be retained when an unrelated process has reused its recorded PID. That may leave recoverable temporary files behind, but it never broadens deletion authority.
# External input bounds

Ownership manifests are external JSON inputs even though the application creates them. Reads are limited to 64 KiB and must prove exact transaction ownership before cleanup. An oversized or malformed manifest is skipped rather than being used to authorize deletion.

## Process-tree completion before cleanup (KAN-13)

A direct worker exit does not authorize commit or deletion. The supervisor retains
its Unix process-group ID after that exit, sends TERM and then KILL under separate
bounded deadlines, and succeeds only when the group is gone. Windows retains the
kill-on-close Job Object and checks its active-process count. Unknown liveness is
treated as active. Nonpositive stop budgets mean no wait, not an infinite Qt wait.

The controller queues its finished handler so a blocking process wait cannot
synchronously destroy the supervisor on its own stack. It remains exporting until
finalization releases ownership. A failed shutdown retains transaction files and
retries finalization; destruction defers file deletion to manifest recovery. A
worker reporting success while descendants remain is treated as failed, preserving
the existing user target. Cancellation cleanup occurs only after writers stop.
